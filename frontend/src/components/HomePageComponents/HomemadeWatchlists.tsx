/* TODO : homemade watchlists component, it has to look like :

- A card per watchlist, exemple : 'Scream Saga', this card needs to have the same format as the poster path of the movies on the carousel
- Each card needs to be clickable : onClick, it opens a dialog with the list of the movies in that watchlist, maybe also like the carousel
- Each movies on the watchlist needs to have the same behavior as the carousel movies (clickable, open dialog with details, rating, comment etc...)
- Each watchlist can be added on the user's watchlists
- Each watchlist can be rated and commented by an user
- This component needs to be above the carousel on the homePage, like a new section
- Ideas of watchlists : 

* 'Scream Saga' : all the movies of the Scream saga
* 'Halloween Saga' : all the movies of the Halloween saga
* 'Friday the 13th Saga' : all the movies of the Friday the 13th saga
* 'Conjuring Universe' : all the movies of the Conjuring universe
* 'Stephen King Adaptations' : all the movies adapted from Stephen King's books
* 'Old but gold' : a list of classic horror movies
* '31 movies until Halloween' : a list of 31 movies to watch until Halloween
* '365 movies until Halloween' : a list of 365 horror movies
* 'Clowns from hell' : a list of horror movies with clowns
* 'Horrific but funny' : a list of horror comedies (Scary Movie, Piranha, Freddy vs Jason etc...)
* 'V/H/S Collection' : a list of horror movies from the V/H/S franchise
* 'Horror animes' : a list of horror anime movies
* 'A24 Horror' : all the horror movies produced by A24
* 'The dev favorites' : a list of the developer's favorite horror movies


QUESTION : 
- Should I do these watchlists in the backend and fetch them here, or should I hardcode them here in the frontend ?
- Is it worth it to make it also for tvshows or only for movies ?
